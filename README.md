SCHOOL 21 PROJECT


Me and my partner - @rtoast - made a team and named it "We think about it tommorow"...
But no, we're didn't procrastinated. Deadlines were coming :)
After almost one month of work we have written our first large partner project - a shorted bash. 

The compilation was performed as follows: gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror.

All files pass to Norminette.

No memory leaks.

Clone it and enjoy!
